# Lean Mean FAT Machine

### Introduction
A framework for fast and easy development of a FAT FS implementation for
[Frosted](https://github.com/insane-adding-machines/frosted).

Aims to provide an environment where all required aspects of
[Frosted](https://github.com/insane-adding-machines/frosted) are emulated to develop and test the FAT FS
implementation in Linux userland.

At this point, only FAT32 is supported.

### Compilation
```$ make```

### Usage
```$ ./lmfm ../sd.img```

### TODO
- testing
- basic interactive shell
